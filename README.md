Community project for increasing accessibility in Age of Empires 2: Definitive Edition
Hey guys, I have been trying to include access for visually impaired gamers. Age of Empires 2 is a game which has existed for over 20 years and yet has very little accessiblity for visually impaired gamers. This is a project started to include such gamers. I would appreciate any help to improve access!
